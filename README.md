## How to launch your project environment

* So easy !!! You just have to clone this repository in your prefered project directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/WizBhoo/docker_sf3-sf4.git
```

* Go to the docker_sf3-sf4 cloned folder with your terminal (you can rename it as you want)

<blockquote>
Note that Make command is available thanks to the Makefile provided.</br>
To know which commands are available use "make help" in your terminal.
</blockquote>

* Use appropriate make command to build containers and launch the docker environment
* Then a make command quickly allows you to launch Symfony project installation :</br>
"make project-init" command will launch by default (adapt makefile for Symfony 4.* project) :

```
docker exec -it -u 1000 php-fpm composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton:3.4.* symfony
```

* Well done, you are ready to work on your Symfony project ! Look into the Symfony folder created... and init git with a first commit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advanced configuration

* Two virtual hosts are defined for locally use : mon-site.local (site homepage)  &  pma.local (PHPMyAdmin interface).
So don't forget to add them to your hosts file if you want to use them.
* In the docker-compose file you will find environment variables for MySQL and PHPMyAdmin. You can edit them at your convenience.
* It's very easy to make this stack operationnal for a Symfony project version 3.2.*
    * Go to edit the .docker/nginx/conf/conf.d/mon-site.conf file.
    * Replace inside the main site root : for Symfony 3.2.* the folder is "web" instead of "public"
    * Edit each line where you find "index".php and replace by "app_dev".php
* Re-build containers / Re-run them / Work DONE ! / ENJOY !

<blockquote>
Note that you need to edit the makefile too if you want. Make project-init command has to refer to :</br>
docker exec -it -u 1000 php-fpm composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition:3.2.* symfony
