    *   Composer
    *   Symfony
    *   Zsh / Ho-My-Zsh

## How to launch your project environment

*   So easy !!! You just have to clone this repository in your preferred project directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/WizBhoo/docker_sf3_to_sf5.git
```

*   Go to the docker_sf3_to_sf5 cloned folder with your terminal (you can rename it as you want).

<blockquote>
Note that Make command is available thanks to the Makefile provided.

To know which commands are available use "make help" in your terminal.
</blockquote>

*   Use appropriate make command to build containers and launch the docker environment.
*   Then a make command quickly allows you to launch Symfony project installation : "make project-init" command will launch by default (adapt makefile for Symfony 4.* or 5.* project) :

```
docker exec -it -u 1000 php-fpm composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton:3.4.* symfony
```

*   Well done, you are ready to work on your Symfony project ! Look into the Symfony folder created... and init git with a first commit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advanced configuration

*   Two virtual hosts are defined for locally use : [mon-site.localhost](http://mon-site.localhost) (site homepage)  &  [pma.localhost](http://pma.localhost) (PHPMyAdmin interface).
So don't forget to add them to your hosts file if you want to use them. (=> NB : No need anymore since Version of January 2020).
*   In the docker-compose file you will find environment variables for MySQL and PHPMyAdmin. You can edit them at your convenience.
*   It's very easy to make this stack operational for a Symfony project version 3.2.*
    *   Go to edit the .docker/nginx/conf/conf.d/mon-site.conf file.
    *   Replace inside the main site root : for Symfony 3.2.* the folder is "web" instead of "public".
    *   Edit each line where you find "index".php and replace by "app_dev".php.
*   Re-build containers / Re-run them / Work DONE ! / ENJOY !

<blockquote>
Note that you need to edit the makefile too if you want. Make project-init command has to refer to :

docker exec -it -u 1000 php-fpm composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition:3.2.* symfony
